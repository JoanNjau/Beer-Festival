Since the year 1985,the highest record of attendees was set at 444,000 daily guests and 7.1 Million total guests,which is yet to be broken till date - as seen from the dashboard shared.The lowest number of daiy guests at the festival,however,was 329,000 in 2016 while that of the total guests was 5.5 Million in 2001.

The longest duration for the festival was 18 hours, in comparison to the 16 hours for the shortest.

A linear relationship was noted between the beer price and consumption in that,the two variables were directly proportional - with an exception on the festivals that lasted for 17 hrs.On the contrary,the relationship between the roast chicken prices and consumption was directly opposite to that of the beer since the two variables were indirectly proportional.

A conclusion that can be drawn on the consumption of these two products is that,the higher prices of roast chicken did not generate as much sales as lower prices did.However,this did not hold for the rate of beer consumption as it was high particularly when the prices were high as well.
